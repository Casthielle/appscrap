## Background and motivation

Most banks do not offer public APIs and the only way to access your data (balance and transactions) is through their websites ... and most of the websites of banks are a nightmare.

We are developers and we do not want to waste time doing things that are able to automate. Having to make 20 clicks in a horrible site just to check the amount of money we have is not something we like.


## Installation

### From Git

You can check out the latest source from git:

    git clone https://github.com/Casthielle/appscrap.git


## Requirements

To perform operations on the BBVA bank, you need to add the details of your code card on file ' /src/appscrap.py ' in codecard variable. For example:

And get its balance:
```python
codecard = {
			"A1":"106", "A2":"745", "A3":"078", "A4":"584", "A5":"396", "A6":"818", "A7":"537", "A8":"577", "A9":"184", "A10":"380",
			"B1":"555", "B2":"103", "B3":"740", "B4":"924", "B5":"131", "B6":"482", "B7":"028", "B8":"116", "B9":"040", "B10":"282",
			"C1":"434", "C2":"608", "C3":"027", "C4":"452", "C5":"194", "C6":"085", "C7":"633", "C8":"058", "C9":"427", "C10":"897",
			"D1":"126", "D2":"477", "D3":"292", "D4":"583", "D5":"052", "D6":"275", "D7":"951", "D8":"162", "D9":"162", "D10":"709",
			"E1":"917", "E2":"549", "E3":"889", "E4":"154", "E5":"316", "E6":"903", "E7":"874", "E8":"892", "E9":"136", "E10":"587",
			"F1":"997", "F2":"146", "F3":"524", "F4":"056", "F5":"402", "F6":"290", "F7":"848", "F8":"690", "F9":"133", "F10":"522",
			"G1":"149", "G2":"089", "G3":"109", "G4":"390", "G5":"546", "G6":"016", "G7":"669", "G8":"509", "G9":"812", "G10":"419",
			"H1":"974", "H2":"639", "H3":"670", "H4":"119", "H5":"646", "H6":"272", "H7":"565", "H8":"489", "H9":"207", "H10":"049"
		}
```

## Usage

### From terminal
#### Bank account balance

###### BBVA | Mercantil

    $ python appscrap.py YOUR_BANK balance --user YOUR_BANK_USER --password YOUR_BANK_PASSWORD

or

	$ python appscrap.py YOUR_BANK balance -u YOUR_BANK_USER -p YOUR_BANK_PASSWORD

#### Last Transactions
###### BBVA | Mercantil

    $ python appscrap.py YOUR_BANK transactions --user YOUR_BANK_USER --password YOUR_BANK_PASSWORD

or

	$ python appscrap.py YOUR_BANK transactions -u YOUR_BANK_USER -p YOUR_BANK_PASSWORD


If you don't want to pass your user and password everytime you can define them in your .bash_profile by adding:
